Juno
====

__NOT READY YET__

Wife of Zeus. A very nagging, distrustful and monitoring wife.

Juno provides a web interface for monitoring [Raekke](http://github.com/henrikbjorn/Raekke) and its redis server(s).
Juno is built ontop of Flint but can be used standalone by including the service provider and routing into your own application.
